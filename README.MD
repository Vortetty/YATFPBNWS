# YATFPBNWS

Started this project as a way to distract from a pending doctors appt, will continue work because i do not value my time.

Neofetch is slow and no longer updated, congrats to the maintainer for finding his calling :3

Crystal/Arch Linux is the only semi-guaranteed support, everything else is implemented if you are lucky or make a PR. I do have plans to support other systems in the future but it will be a bit

## Todo

- [ ] Unfuck all of that lack of error handling

### Code Style

- Avoid oneline if-statements for readability
- Do whatever is most readable for the code, prefer readability over size optimization
- Keep lines short if possible, split calls on function return values onto new lines
